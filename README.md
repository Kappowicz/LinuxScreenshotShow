# LinuxScreenshotShow
This simple script allows you to capture a screenshot of a selected area, display it in the default image viewer, and save it to a designated directory. 

To use this script, just modify the `SCREENSHOT_PATH` in the script to your preferred location. You can also add this script to your keyboard shortcuts for quick access. I've set it to Win+Shift+S, similar to the shortcut in Windows.

Known Issues:
Don't close the default image viewer before you paste the image, or it will just paste text of disk localization.
